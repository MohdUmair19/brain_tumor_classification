# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification  
**Image Classification with DenseNet121 and NASNet on a Large Dataset**  

This project contains Jupyter notebooks for training and evaluating deep learning models—**DenseNet121** and **NASNetLarge**—on a large image dataset. Both models are built using **pretrained architectures from Keras Applications** and fine-tuned for custom image classification tasks.
